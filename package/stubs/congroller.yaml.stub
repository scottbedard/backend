# controller class
# in you're making something custom, extend this base class
controller: \Bedard\Backend\BackendController

# name
# set this for default page titles, button text, etc...
name: :entity

# base permissions
# users must have ALL of the following permissions
permissions:
    - read :entities

# routes allow different pages to be registered
routes:

    # route names map to controller methods. in most situations you
    # only need yaml to define pages, here is an index list for example
