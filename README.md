## Installation

No documentation yet, check back later.

## Getting started

Backend areas are defined using `yaml` files. Let's look at an example `users.yaml` file and see how they work.

```yaml
# these define the permissions required to access the controller.
# this includes the nav, routes, and all other items
permissions:
    - read users

# this property adds an item to the main backend navigation.
# see the notes below for more info on icons
nav:
    href: /backend/users
    icon: users
    label: Users
    
# the eloquent model that plugins should use.
# if needed, this can be overwritten for individual routes.
model: App\Models\User

# subnavs add a secondary nav bar to all of this controller's routes.
# to restrict link visibility, define a permissions array.
subnav:
    -
        href: /backend/users
        icon: users
        label: Users
    -
        href: /backend/users/groups
        icon: folder
        label: Groups
        permissions:
            - read user groups

# routes are managed by plugins. see the documentation below for info on the
# built-in ones, and on how to create your own.
routes:

    # routes can define a path property, null values target the controller base.
    # if none is defined, it will be inferred from the route name (like "create" below!).
    index:
        path: null
        plugin: list
        options:
            # ...

    # routes inherit the permissions of their controller, but may also define their own
    # to be required in addition to these.
    create:
        plugin: form
        options:
            # ...
        permissions:
            - create users
```

## Plugins

No documentation yet, check back later.

## Super admins

The `super admin` role enables all other roles and permissions, **<ins>including the ability to create other super admins</ins>**. If needed, this role can be renamed using the `BACKEND_SUPER_ADMIN_ROLE` environment variable. Execute the following to create a super admin.

```sh
php artisan backend:assign-role {id} 'super admin'
```
